# Model Card for Cats vs Dogs image classification

This model uses a Fine-Tunned version of [google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) Vision Transformer to classify images from the Cats vs. Dogs dataset. It takes input images and predicts whether they contain a cat or a dog.

## Model Details

### Model Description

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. 

Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.

Note that this model does not provide any fine-tuned heads, as these were zero'd by Google researchers. However, the model does include the pre-trained pooler, which can be used for downstream tasks (such as image classification).

By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.

By fine-tunning the model, it learns threats of cat and dog images that allow the model to extract relevant features of the two types of images, allowing the model to learn how to classify properly different images than the ones used for training.

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

### Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->

{{ direct_use | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Downstream Use [optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

{{ downstream_use | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}


## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model is limited by its training data and may perform poorly on images outside the Cats vs. Dogs dataset. It might not generalize well to other types of animal images without further fine-tuning.

This model does not present significant ethical concerns but should be used responsibly, ensuring datasets used for further training or deployment are appropriately labeled and free of bias.


### Recommendations

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.
